    <h3>"Facebook feels like a mall. Twitter feels like the street."</br>    -William Gibson</h3>
    <p>As succinct as this comment is, in one important aspect it is not true. On the street, geography is paramount. On Twitter, it is a little line in a user profile.</p>
    <p>This website seeks to restore geography's place in the wonderful absurdity that is Twitter. Enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Are you some kind of CIA-sponsored hacker?</h3>
    <p>I wish. Any Tweets displayed from a public (as opposed to protected) account. Such Tweets can be readily accessed through Twitter. This website simply displays them geographically.</p>
    <h3>How do you determine the location of Tweets?</h3>
    <p>When someone geocodes his or her Tweets, I take that location. More often, I apply a few heuristics, and then use Google's geocoding service to determine the coordinates of the location given in one's Twitter profile.</p>
    <h3>My Tweets, or my child's Tweets, are on this map and I do not want them to be. What can I do?</h3>
    <p>If you are tweeting your exact location, either disable the geocoding function of the Twitter account or make the account protected. If you are not, first ask yourself if you really care that the Tweets are always marked someplace downtown. If you do, either erase the location from your Twitter profile or make the account protected.</p>
    <h3>My Tweets are not on this map and I want them to be. What can I do?</h3>
    <p>First, make sure the Twitter account is public. Then, if you want your exact location displayed, enable the geocoding function. If you want the same location displayed for each of your Tweets, type that location in your profile. Note that if you do both, the exact location will be marked whenever possible.</p>
    <h3>I use the pin and I get a cluster of results near it and then two in other continents. Why?</h3>
    <p>One possibility is Retweets. Someone near your pin retweeted someone elsewhere. When Twitter allows me to address this situation, I will. Another is that, during the course of handling 200 million daily Tweets, Twitter simply returned incorrect information.</p>
    <h3>I see a profile whose location is "The World" and its Tweets show up in the Hague. Why?</h3>
    <p>In such ambiguous situations, Google's geocoding service takes a best guess. It is often ingenious, sometimes whimsical, and other times grossly inaccurate. "TO," a common moniker for Toronto, is apparently in the middle of Brazil. I have considered ways to avoid displaying such locations, but none are foolproof and all will take time to program. Remember that no information from this site will ever be admissible in any self-respecting court of law. Pin Tweets if for fun.</p>
    <h3>Is there anyone you would like to acknowledge?</h3>
    <p>I send my respect and gratitude to Justin Martinez, Brendan Nee, and Jack Reilly for lending me their expertise in developing this website. I also send my appreciation to Google and Twitter for their API's.</p>
